[{"date": "04/22/24", "body": " \n\n\nHi,\n            \n\n\nHappy new year!. This is the first of many, many emails that you will get for me. You can view that either as a promise or a threat. \u00a0I am delighted that you have decided to take the corporate finance class this spring with me and especially so if you are not a finance major and have never worked in finance. I am an evangelist when it comes to the centrality of corporate finance and I will try very hard to convert you to my faith. I also know that some of you may be worried about the class and the tool set that you will bring to it. \u00a0I cannot alleviate all your fears now, but here are a few things that you can do to get an early jump:\n\n\n1. Pre-work for class\n\n\na.\u00a0Get a financial calculator and do not throw away the manual. I know that you feel more comfortable using Excel, but you will need a calculator for your quizzes/exams.\n\nb. The only prior knowledge that I will draw on will be in basic accounting, statistics and present value. If you feel shaky, you may want to check out the online classes that I have on accounting , financing basics and statistics\nAccounting class (I am not an accountant, don\u2019t care much for how accountants think about companies and view accounting as a raw material provider.. This class reflects that view):\u00a0http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/New_Home_Page/webcastacctg.htm\u00a0\nBasics of finance (present value, a dash of this and that\u2026.):\u00a0http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/New_Home_Page/webcastfoundationsonline.htm\u00a0\nFor statistics, all I can offer you for the moment is a primer (though I am\u00a0working on a mini-class):\u00a0http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/New_Home_Page/webcaststatistics.htm\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n                  2. Class Details/Logistics\n\n\n\n                As things stand now, and this could quickly change, we will meet in Paulson Auditorium, a cavernous amphitheater with all \u00a0of the charm of Madison Square Garden on a bad day (which would be any day that the Knicks actually play there) every Monday and Wednesday, starting on January 29, going through May 6, from 10.30 am to 11.50 am. I will not take attendance, but I would really, really, really like to see you in class. If you do miss a class, the sessions will be recorded and will be available in three places:\n\n\nMy website at:\u00a0http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/webcastcfspr24.htm\u00a0\nOn YouTube as a playlist:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUkh9m2BorqmVj3HYDgKg2VPUKoXcBALF\nOn Brightspace (NYU\u2019s \u00a0learning platform)\n\n\nYou can find out all you need to know about the class (for the moment) by going to the web page for the class:\n\nhttp://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/corpfin.html\u00a0\n                This page has everything connected to the class, including webcast links, lecture notes and project links. The syllabus has been updated:\nhttps://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/cfovhds/cfsyllspr24.pdf\n                \u00a0If you click on the calendar link, you will be taken to a Google calendar of everything related to this class.\u00a0\nhttps://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_022970abf678060ea60965b8a2aad169a4ed41983f6bc594705964b47961f36c@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York\n\n \n\nYou will note references to a project which will be consuming your lives for the next four months. This project will essentially require you to do a full corporate financial analysis of a company. While there is nothing you need to do at the moment for the project, you can start thinking about a company you would like to analyze and a group that you want to be part of. \u00a0\n\n\n3. Class Material\n\nNow for the material for the class. The lecture notes for the class are available as a pdf file that you can download and print. I have both a standard version (one slide per page) and an environmentally friendly version (two slides per page) to download. You can also save paper entirely and download the file to your iPad or Kindle. The first packed can be found at the link below\nhttps://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/cfovhds/cfpacket1spr24.pdf\nThere is a book for the class, Applied Corporate Finance, but please make sure that you get the fourth edition. It is exorbitantly over priced but you can buy, rent or download it at\u00a0Amazon.com\u00a0or the NYU bookstore\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Applied-Corporate-Finance-Aswath-Damodaran-ebook/dp/B00P6SS6MU/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1421799164&sr=1-1&keywords=applied+corporate+finance+4th+edition\nWhile I have no qualms about wasting your money, I know that some of you are budget constrained (a nice way of saying \"poor\") . If you really, really cannot afford the book, you should be able to live without it.\u00a0\n\n\n4. Final Thoughts\nI know that In the last decade, we have been forced to reexamine accepted wisdom in pretty much aspect of life, and corporate finance is no exception. As we struggle with the new and the different, we have to \u00a0incorporate the lessons learned, unlearned and relearned over this period into corporate finance, and I will tru. There are assumptions that we have made for decades that need to be challenged and foundations that have to be reinforced. In other words, the time for cookbook and me-too finance (which is what too many firms, investment banks and consultants have indulged in) is over. \u00a0At the same time, there is a whole lot nonsense that has been bandied about as the \u201cnew way to run business\u201d and I will not mince any words (or spare any feelings) in talking about them. \u00a0To close, I will leave you with a YouTube video that introduces you (in about 2 minutes) to the class.\u00a0\nhttps://youtu.be/N91AXV7LMrg\nI hope you enjoy it. \u00a0That is about it. I am looking forward to this class. It has always been my favorite class to teach (even more so than valuation, my other teaching venture) and I have a singular objective.\u00a0I would like to make it the best class you have ever taken, period. I know that this is going to be tough to pull off but I will really try. I hope to see you on January 29th, in class. Until next time!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"date": "04/29/24", "body": "\n\nI hope that you have had a good week since my last email, and if your response is what last email, you may want to check this link:\nhttp://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/cfemail.html\nNext week, at the first class, I will spend time laying out what the class is about, what I hope that we will accomplish during the semester, as well as establish the key themes that underlie corporate finance. You can download the syllabus ahead of time:\n\nhttps://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/cfovhds/cfsyllspr24.pdf\nAs you read the syllabus, you will notice mention of a project and in case you are curious, here is the link to the project resources:\nhttp://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/New_Home_Page/cfproj.html\nOnce we are through the syllabus in the first session, we will turn our attention to the lecture note packets, and every slide you see in class after this will be in that packet. The lecture notes are in two parts, and the first part can be obtained at this link (which I sent you last week as well):\nhttps://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/cfovhds/cfpacket1spr24.pdf\u00a0\nIt is also available in powerpoint form (though the file size is bloated), if you go to the lecture note page or webcast page of the class..\n\n\nNow that I have drowned you in stuff, just a little aside. I don\u2019t much care for academic research and almost everything that I write is for practitioners, and my blog (sounds new age, doesn\u2019t it?) has become the first repository for my writing. I spend the first few weeks of each year, talking about the data that I update on my website:\nhttp://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/data.html\n\nThe first two updates re on my blog. Please browse through them, because they are relevant for class:\n\n\nhttps://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2024/01/data-update-1-for-2024-data-speaks-but.html\nhttps://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2024/01/data-update-2-for-2024-stock-comeback.html\n\n\n\nI will see you in class next week (Monday. January 29, at 10.30 m, NY time on in Paulson Auditorium.

When I start class tomorrow, it will be my 40th year teaching and I am thankful that I still look forward to the day. There is no other profession where you can start with a clean slate every few months, even though you may screw it up in the subsequent days and weeks. We will meet in Paulson from 10.30 am - 11.50 am for our first class, and it will be glorious (I have got to hype it up as much as I can). I do realize that some of you will not be able to make it in class for a variety of reasons, and worry not, since the class will be carried live on Zoom.

Here is the first of many, many missives that you will receive for me\u2026.. First, a quick review of what we did in today's class.\u00a0\u00a0I laid out the structure for the class and an agenda of what I hope to accomplish during the next 15 weeks. In addition to describing the logistical details, I presented my view that corporate finance is the ultimate big picture class because everything falls under its purview. The \u201cbig picture\u201d of corporate finance covers the three basic decisions that every business has to make: how to allocate scarce funds across competing uses (the investment decision), how to raise funds to finance these investments (the financing decision) and how much cash to take out of the business (the dividend decision). The singular objective in corporate finance is to maximize the value of the business to its owners. This big picture was then used to emphasize five themes: that corporate finance is common sense, that it is focused, that the focus shifts over the life cycle and that you cannot break first principles with immunity.\n\n\nOn to housekeeping details.\u00a0\n\n\n\n1. Project Group: \u00a0For the moment, try to at least find a group that you can work with for the rest of the semester. Find people you like/trust/can get along with/ will not kill before the end of the semester. The group should be at least 4 and can be up to 8 (if you can handle the logistics). Each person will be picking a company and having a larger group will not mean less work. This group will do both a case and the project, both of which I will talk about next class. I know that a few of you are feeling lost and abandoned because you know no one in the class. If you are one of the lost souls, I have created an orphan list towards the end of this week, add your name into this list and you will be adopted (even if I have to get Sally Struthers to do the sales pitch):\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGTEKWRLJuQ\u00a0\n\n\n2. Webcasts: The webcasts should be up \u00a0a little while after the class ends. Please use the webcasts as a back-up, in case you cannot make it to class or have to review something that you did not get during class, rather than as replacement for coming to class. I would really, really like to see you in class, unless of course you have physical or health reasons for not being there. \u00a0The web casts for the first class are up now and you can get them at\n\nhttps://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/webcastcfspr24.htm\u00a0\n\nTry it out and let me know what you think. I have been told that it comes through best if you have a 70 inch flat panel TV and surround sound. You will also find the syllabus and project description in pdf format to download and print on this page. The lecture note packet is also on this page.

Even if I forget to attach these on future emails, there will be a post class test and solution for every class on the webcast page for the class.\n\n\n\nThat is about it, for this email. Until next time!\nAtttachments: Post-class test and solution"}, {"date": "05/07/24", "body": "In the first puzzle for this semester, I am going to focus on the objective in corporate finance, In class, I said that the end game is to maximize the value of the business and that objective has given corporate finance its focus, but has also given rise to criticism that it comes at the expense of other claimholders. That is a legitimate point, and even the Business Roundtable seemed to come around to a stakeholder point of view in this missive:\nhttps://opportunity.businessroundtable.org/ourcommitment/\nIn a post shortly thereafter, I took issue with the Business Roundtable, and argued that it was the wrong message and that the messenger, Jamie Dimon, was singularly ill equipped to talk about shareholder interests, given how cavalierly he has ignored them over his tenure.\u00a0\nhttps://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2019/08/from-shareholder-wealth-to-stakeholder.html\nI know that many of you will disagree with me on my conclusions, but I think that this will be a great start for tomorrow\u2019s class.

You can post your thoughts, any interesting links or dissenting points of view there. U"}, {"date": "05/08/24", "body": "\nIn today's class, we started on what the objective in running a business should be. While corporate finance states it to be maximizing firm value, it is often practiced as maximizing stock price. To make the world safe for stock price maximization, we do have to make key assumptions: that managers act in the best interests of stockholders, that lenders are fully protected, that information flows to rational investors and that there are no social costs. \u00a0We started on why one of these assumptions, that stockholders have power over managers, fails and we will continue ripping the Utopian world apart next class.\u00a0\n\n\n1. Other People's Money:\u00a0Just a few added notes relating to the class\u00a0that I want to bring to your attention. The first is the movie Other People's Money, which is one of my favorites for illustrating the straw men that people like to set up and knock down. You can find out more about the movie here:\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102609/\nBut I found the best part on YouTube. It is Danny DeVito's \"Larry the Liquidator\" speech:\u00a0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOcz-H5u3Rk\u00a0\nWatch it when you get a chance. Not only is it entertaining but it is a learning experience (though I am not sure what you learn). Incidentally, it is much, much better than Michael Douglas's \"Greed is good\" speech in the first \"Wall Street \" which was a blatant rip-off of Ivan Boesky's graduation address to the UC Berkeley MBAs in 1986 (which I happened to be at, since I was teaching there that year).\u00a0\n\n\n2. DisneyWar: In next week\u2019s session, I will be talking about the dysfunctional state of Disney in the 1990s. If you want to review these on your own, try this book written by James Stewart. It is in paperback, \u00a0on Amazon:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/DisneyWar-James-B-Stewart/dp/B000W3W6NO\n\u00a0If you want a more contemporary version of how Disney\u2019s corporate governance is playing out, and want an insider\u2019s perspective, Bob Iger\u2019s autobiography is a solid bet:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Ride-Lifetime-Lessons-Learned-Company/dp/0399592091\u00a0\n\n\n3. Company Choice: On the question of picking companies for your group, some (unsolicited) advice:\u00a0\n\n\n\n(1)\u00a0Define your theme broadly: In other words, don't pick five airlines as your group. Pick United Airlines, Southwest, Singapore Airlines, Travelocity and Embraer.... Three\u00a0\u00a0very different airline firms, a travel service and a company that sells aircraft to the airlines.\n\n\n(2)\u00a0Do not worry about making a mistake: If you pick a company that you regret picking later, you can go back and change your pick.... If you do it in the first 5 weeks, it will not be the end of the world.\n\n\n(3) If you are leery about picking a foreign company, pick one that has ADRs (these are Depository Receipts that are traded in US dollars) listed in the US. It will make your life a little easier. You should still use the information related to the local listing (rather than the ADR).\n\n\n(4) If you want to sound me out on your picks, go ahead. I have to tell you up front that I think that there is some aspect that will be interesting no matter what company you pick. So, do not avoid a company simply because it pays no dividends or has no debt.\n\n\n(5) If you want to kill two birds with one stone, pick a company that you already own stock in, or plan to work for, or with.\n(6) Avoid money losing companies, unless the loss was a one-time deal, and financial service firms, which are so constrained that they are no fun to work with.\n(7) Once you have a company, please enter the name of your company in the class Google spreadsheet:\u00a0https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KZM6yNx4SXjgbaOUV4iubV-xLc5dPQsbfizsBYnquyo/edit?usp=sharing\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a final reminder. Please pick your company soon... As you can see from today's class, we are getting started on assessing your company\u2026\n4. If you want to download the financial statements for your company, I would recommend that you start with the annual report for the most recent year. You should be able to pull it off the website for the company, under investor relations. If you want to keep going, and it is a US company, go to o the SEC site (https://www.sec.gov/edgar). If it is a non-US company, you will have to find the equivalent regulatory body in your country. For some of your companies, you will find less data than on others. Don\u2019t fret. It is what it is. Finally, I am attaching the post class test and solution for today\u2019s session\n\nAttachments: Post-class test and solution"}, {"date": "05/09/24", "body": "It is never too early to start nagging you about the project. So, let me get started with a checklist (which is short for this week but will get longer each week. Here is the list of things that would be nice to get behind you:\n\n\nProject hub: To find out pretty much anything you need to about the project, get questions answered or look at past project reports, here is where you should go:\u00a0http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/New_Home_Page/cfproj.html\u00a0\nFind a group: If you have trouble finding one, try the orphan spreadsheet for the class\u00a0https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bWDy_H3VOsv8xU92c8HNarPiJJQKMLThlaDvb7IySyA/edit?usp=sharing. If you have a group and need an orphan to adopt, try the spreadsheet as well.\u00a0\nPick a company/theme: This will require some coordination across the group but pick a company and find a theme that works for the group. Each person in the group picks a company and the companies form the theme. Once you have picked the company, please enter the company\u2019s name into this spreadsheet (recognizing that you can come back and change it, if you change your mind):\u00a0https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KZM6yNx4SXjgbaOUV4iubV-xLc5dPQsbfizsBYnquyo/edit?usp=sharing\u00a0\nAnnual Report: Find the most recent annual report for your company. If it is a US company, also download the 10K from the SEC website.\nUpdated information: If your company has quarterly reports or filings pull them up as well.\nBoard of Directors: Get a listing of the board of directors for your company & start your preliminary assessment.\n\nIn doing all of this, you will need data and Stern subscribes to one of the two industry standards: S&P Capital IQ (the other is Factset).\u00a0It is truly a remarkable dataset with hundreds of items on tens of thousands of public companies listed globally, including corporate governance measures.\u00a0To get access to Capital IQ, you need to ask for it, and the attached document leads you through the process. As with all things IT related, I am sure\u00a0that there are glitches and if you find them, let me know.\n\n\nThis is the seventh or eighth email for the class. If you have not been receiving these emails (which means that you are reading this in the chronicles), it is worth noting that I don\u2019t keep an email list for the class. I use the Google groups that Stern creates. In theory, students registered for the class should be on Albert (the NYU official registration/grading site), Brightspace and Google Groups, and the three should be synced, but this is a university. What should be true in theory is not always the case in practice. I can do very little to alter the Google groups. If you are finding yourself locked out of the email list, start with IT, and if they won\u2019t help, I will figure out a way to add you in. If you are a non-Stern student, and have an email address that does not end\u00a0in@stern.nyu.edu, note that you were assigned a stern email address when you joined this class, and you should be able to find that address.\u00a0Here is what I got from IT when I asked:\n\nSince you are teaching a Stern course, all your students, exchange and non-Stern, are provided with a Stern account and Gmail.\nYou can have them all head over to 'start.stern.nyu.edu' to activate their account.\n\n\n\nOn a completely unrelated note, it may be a little early to be talking to me or the TAs, but here are the logistical details on office hours (for all of us) and the TA review sessions that will occur every week:\nMy office hours: \u00a0You can come my office, in person, in KMEC 9-69 or on Zoom, since NYU is not allowing in-person yet, will be at:\n12 pm- 1.15 pm, MW: \u00a0https://nyu.zoom.us/j/97017751425\u00a0\nI will add on more hours as we get closer to quizzes and exams and project due dates.\nTA office hours\nLambert and Jose will be having office hours as well.

In the utopian world, the power lies entirely with shareholders, but in the real world, that is not often the case. It can lie with managers, if shareholdings are diffuse and shareholders are passive.\u00a0It \u00a0can lie with a subset of inside shareholders, who have large holdings and/or are part of incumbent management. In some cases, that power can come from having voting and non-voting shares. It can lie with governments, lenders or employees. The first step in understanding why a company does what it does is to assess the power structure, and I suggested that you look at the largest shareholders in the company. One source for this is Bloomberg, and while almost all of the information you will find on it can be found elsewhere, it does provide a convenient place to get information. The first step is finding a Bloomberg Terminal, and there are three on the fourth floor of KMEC, in the MBA Study Room. I have never used them, but reliable sources have told me that\u00a0that the usernames and passwords are in the computer wallpers (they are BBREADING1, 2 or 3 and then a password that is Alpha, Delta or Gamma followed by numbers).\u00a0Once you are able to get on the terminal, type in the name of your company and a bunch of listings on your company will show up. It may take a little trial and error, but you should eventually find your local listing of your stock.\u00a0If you can get on \u00a0a\u00a0Bloomberg terminal, try this:\n1. Press the EQUITY button\n2. Choose FIND YOUR SECURITY\n3. Type the name of your company\n4. You might get multiple listings for your company, especially if it is a large company with multiple listings and securities. Try to find your local listing. For a US company, this will usually be the one with your stock symbol followed by US. For a non-US company, it will have the exchange symbol for your country (GR: Germany, FP: France, LN: UK etc...) It may take some trial and error to find the listing....\n5. Type in HDS\n6. Print off the first page of the HDS (it should have the top 17 investors in your company).\nIf you cannot get to a Bloomberg, much of that same information is available on Yahoo! Finance and other online financial data providers. .\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the discussion of what happens when power rests with another stakeholder group. I talked about my Petrobras post. The link is below:\nhttps://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2015/02/how-low-can-you-go-doing-petrobras-limbo.html.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWe then turned our attention to the differences in interests between lenders and shareholders, when it comes to running a firm, and argued that lenders to businesses who don\u2019t protect themselves risk being Nabiscoed. Moving on to the relationship between firms and markets, I noted the flaws in both parts of the Utopian assumption of free/honest information flow and rational markets, with information often delayed/gamed and sometimes fraudulent in a market that is often no rational, leaving us with the uneasy question of where to put our trusts - markets that may or may not be short, managers who claim to be long term but often are not or expert groups that when they make mistakes are unable to accept them.\u00a0Next session, we will move past listing the problems to thinking about solutions.\nAttachments: Post-class test and solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"date": "05/14/24", "body": "At the outset, a quick note about office hours tomorrow. Since there ia faculty meeting from 12 pm - 1.30 pm, I will move the office hours to 9 am - 10 am. The zoom link for office hours remains unchanged. \u00a0In this week\u2019s puzzle, I thought I would use the recent kerfuffle at the Adani Group to talk about corporate governance in family group companies., You can find the puzzle described here:\nhttps://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar//New_Home_Page/cfpuzzles/cfspr23puzzle2.html\u00a0\u00a0\nThat puzzle points you towards two posts from my blog. In the first post, I wrote a long time ago, where trouble was brewing at the Tata Group, the family group controlling Tata Motors:\n        https://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2016/11/the-4c-tradeoff-promise-and-peril-of.html\nI note the pluses and minuses for shareholders from investing in family group companies. I then turn to my last year's post on the Adani Grop, \u00a0a first-generation family group company founded by Gautam Adani. It is heavily focused on infrastructure business, is connected strongly to political power in India and has seen its market cap zoom over the last two years in particular. In the post, I look at the Adani Group's growth over time, and examine how it has become the focus of a US-based short seller in Hindenburg, which contends that the group has indulged in earnings and price manipulation, and that institutions have looked away.\u00a0\nhttps://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2023/02/control-and-complexity-deconstructing.html\nIn the post, I also look at the ownership structure for the Adani Group and note that not only does the group control 73% of the shares outstanding in the company, but that statistic has barely budged over the last decade, even as the company has grown massively. There is a valuation in the post, but I would like your focus to stay on corporate governance at Adani specifically and at family group companies, in general. The puzzle ends with five questions:\n\nIn terms of mechanics, how does a family keep its ownership stake intact as a company is growing?\n\n\nThe Hindenburg report points to shell companies in the Mauritius that own shares in the Adani Group but are controlled by the family? How do these shell companies play out in the corporate governance game?\nAs a shareholder in the Adani Group, do you think that you as a shareholder had any say in how the company was run just a few months?\nAre you more likely to be listened to now, and why?\nIn family group companies, what are the risks that you are exposed to as a shareholder, and how you factor that in, when investing in these companies?\nIn family group companies, is it a given that shareholders have no power? In other words, if you are a member of a family group that controls publicly traded companies, how would you go about fostering corporate governance (giving shareholders more power in the company) and why might you do it?\n\n\n\nGive it a shot and you don\u2019t need a finance background to do it. It is all about power.\u00a0\n"}, {"date": "05/15/24", "body": "he objective function matters, and there are no perfect\u00a0objectives. That is the message of the last two classes. Once you\u00a0have absorbed that, I am willing to accept the fact that you still\u00a0don't quite buy into the \"maximize value\" objective. That is fine and\u00a0I\u00a0would like you to keep thinking about a better alternative with three caveats. First, you cannot cop out and give me multiple objectives -\u00a0I\u00a0too would like to maximize stockholder wealth, maximize customer\u00a0satisfaction, maximize social welfare and employee benefits at the\u00a0same time but it is just not doable. Second, your objective function\u00a0has to be measurable. In other words, if you define your objective as\u00a0maximizing the social good, how would you measure social good? \u00a0Third, take your objective (and the measurement device you have developed) and ask yourself a cynical question: How might managers game this system for maximum benefit, while hurting you as an owner? In the long term, you may almost guarantee that this will happen.\u00a0\n\n\n Building on the theme of social good and stockholder wealth a\u00a0little more, there are a number of fascinating moral and ethical\u00a0issues that arise when you are the manager in a publicly traded firm.\u00a0Is your first duty to society (to which we all belong) or to the\u00a0stockholders (who are your ultimate employers)? If you have to pick\u00a0between the two and you choose the former, do you have an obligation\u00a0to be honest and let the latter know?\u00a0\u00a0What if you believed that the market was overvaluing your stock? Should you sit back and let it happen, since it is good for your stockholders, or should you try to talk the stock price down? On the question of socially responsibility, there are groups out there that rank companies based upon social responsibility. I have listed a few below, but they are a few of many:\nJUST Capital:\u00a0https://justcapital.com/rankings/\nCalvert Social Index:\u00a0https://www.calvert.com/calvert-indexes.php\nDow Jones Sustainability Index:\u00a0https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/esg/sp-500-sustainability-screened-index/#overview\nAnd this is just the tip of the iceberg. Environmental organizations, labor unions and other groups all have their own corporate rankings. In other words, whatever your key social issue is, there is a way to stay true (as a consumer and investor). Notice how the rankings vary even across the ethics sphere. No surprise that no one has a monopoly on virtue. In the last few years, though, you have the ESG movement push for composite scores for companies, and that has created an eco system that I am cynical about, in terms of what will be ultimately accomplished. If you are interested in my perspective on ESG, please try these two posts that I have on the topic:\n\n\nhttps://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2020/09/sounding-good-or-doing-good-skeptical.html\u00a0\nhttps://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2021/09/the-esg-movement-goodness-gravy-train.html\u00a0\nhttps://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2022/03/esgs-russia-test-moment-to-shine-or.html\n\n\nIn addition, I did mention that the one thing that impact investing does not seem to measure itself on is actual impact, and here is the link:\nhttps://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2023/10/good-intentions-perverse-outcomes.html\n\n\nWhile it may seem like we are paying far too much attention to these minor issues, I think that understanding who has the power to make decisions in a company will have significant consequences for how the company approaches every aspect of corporate finance - which projects it takes, how it funds them and how much it pays in dividends. So, give it your best shot.. On a different note, we will be start on our discussion of risk on Monday. As part of that discussion, we will confront the question of who the marginal investor in your company is. If you have already printed off the list of the top stockholders in your company (HDS page in Bloomberg or the Major Holders page from Yahoo! Finance), bring it with you again. If you have not, please do so before the next class. Also, watch for the in-practice webcast day after tomorrow, because I will go through how to break down the HDS page. \u00a0I am also attaching the post-class test & solution for this session.\n\n\nAttachments: Post-class test and solution"}, {"date": "05/16/24", "body": "As for the project & class, time sure does fly, when you are having fun... We are exactly 15.38% (4 sessions out of 26) through the class (in terms of class time) and we will kick into high gear in the next two weeks. I am going to assume for the moment that my nagging has worked and that you have picked a company to analyze. Here is what you can be doing (or better still, have done already):\n\n\nPick a company:\u00a0If you don\u2019t pick a company, nothing else follows. So, please pick a company and then go to the master list for the class and enter your company on that list:\u00a0https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KZM6yNx4SXjgbaOUV4iubV-xLc5dPQsbfizsBYnquyo/edit?usp=sharing\u00a0\nDownload the latest financials for the company: You don't have to print them off. In fact, I find it convenient to keep them in a folder in pdf format, since my computer can search the document far more quickly than I can. For all companies, this will include the latest annual report and with US companies, try to find the latest 10K and 10Q on the SEC website. If you are analyzing a private business, you will need to get the most recent financial data from the owner (who hopefully is related to you and still likes you\u2026)\nPut the board of directors under a microscope: The first step in understanding your company is to start at the top. Take a look at who sits on the board and how long they have been sitting there. In particular, the question that you are trying to answer is how effective this board will be in keeping any eye on the top management of the company. Start with the cosmetic measures, which is what most corporate governance services and laws focus on, but look for something more tangible. Has the board shown any backbone in stopping or slowing down management? For US companies, a surprisingly rich trove of information on boards of directors, and potential conflicts of interest, is a filing with the SEC, that is DEF-14 or 14A and\u00a0here is what I found for Tesla\u00a0. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000119312523094075/d451342ddef14a.htm).\u00a0If you have a non-US company, you will not find this filing, but sometimes, the absence of information is more powerful than its presence.\nAssess the \"power\" structure: As my good friend, Machiavelli, pointed out, power abhors a vacuum (he said no such thing, but you can pretty much attribute anything to him or Confucius and sound literate). Specifically, try to find who the largest stockholders in your company are. You can get this from the Bloomberg terminals (HDS page), Capital IQ (holders) or online for free (Yahoo! Finance or Morningstar). Once you have this list, here are the questions that you should try to answer:\u00a0\n\nIf you are a small stockholder in this company, do you see any likelihood that any of these stockholders will stand up for stockholder rights or are they more likely to sell and run?\nAre there any stockholders on the list whose interests may lie in something other than maximizing stockholder wealth? (For instance, we talked about the government as a stockholder and how its interests may be different from that of the rest of the stockholders.. Think of an employee pension fund being on that list... Or another company being the largest stockholder\u2026)\n\nActivist Investors: One of the things that tilt the game a little bit more in favor of shareholders in their tussle with managers is the presence of activist investors. The problem with identifying whether your company has activist investors is that these investors (Carl Icahn, Bill Ackman) often operate through entities that don\u2019t obviously contain their names. If you are interested, here is a list of some of the biggest activists. Check to see if they are on your company\u2019s top stockholder list.\u00a0https://www.carriedin.com/activist-investors/\u00a0\nGoodness/Social Standing: As ESG becomes an unstoppable force, companies are eagerly remaking themselves as \u201cgood\u201d companies, and services are racing to provide scores on goodness. I have links to two of the biggest ESG service measurers, but there are others out there that you can access as well. \u00a0Sustainalytics (Morningstar):\u00a0https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-data\u00a0 & \u00a0MSCI ESG:\u00a0https://www.msci.com/our-solutions/esg-investing/esg-ratings\u00a0. Your company may have an ESG score, and you are welcome to use it or abuse it. If not, you may need to make your own assessment.\u00a0\n\n\nI will be putting up a webcast tomorrow on how to analyze the \"top shareholder\" list, using a range of companies. Hope you to get a chance to watch it. I also hope that you have had a chance to register for Capital IQ and if you have not, I am reattaching the directions on how to do so.\u00a0"}, {"date": "05/17/24", "body": "Ahead of Super Bowl weekend , I thought I would get in the in-practice webcast for this week and nag you about your project (yet again).

That said, my point about everything being corporate finance applies starting with the insane amount of money that it will cost a network to carry the Super Bowl today (and whether you can make it back on ad revenues or whether you need the show to boost other shows revenues), whether the halftime show will boost the earnings of the entertainer in question and whether \u00a0the Super Bowl ads you see will be as predictive as the crypto ad that ran a couple of years ago with Larry David and Matt Damon. Inquiring minds want to know. In addition, we have a chance to assess how one person (Taylor Swift) t can alter the value of a sporting franchise. So, as you much your chips and watch Mahomes throw the ball from angles that look physically impossible, start tallying up the numberers.\n\n\nTomorrow, we will complete our discussion of corporate governance and start with a discussion of risk and how it plays out in hurdle rates.

Markets have no ego, and if allowed to play out, will devise corrections to almost every over reach in business, whether it be managers taking advantage of shareholders, borrowers ripping off lenders, companies lying to markets or creating large social costs. My view is that companies should run to maximize value, but that will involve accepts self-constraints on behavior, and even if the market does not recognize it right away, but that managers need to consider the messages in stock prices.\n\n\nWe then moved on to risk and some of you may be regretting the shift from the soft stuff , but trust me that it is still fun.. If it is not, keep telling yourself that it will become fun. Anyway, here are a few thoughts about today's class.\n\n\nThe Essence of Risk:\u00a0There has been risk in investments as long as there have been investments. If you have the time, pick up a copy of Against the Gods by Peter Bernstein, John Wiley and Sons. It is a great book and an easy read. If you want more, you should also pick up a copy of Capital Ideas by Peter as well... That traces out the development of the CAPM....\nMore on Models: If you want to read more about\u00a0the CAPM, you can begin with chapter 3 in my book. It provides an extended discussion of what we talked about in class today\u2026. If you don\u2019t have the book, not a big deal!\nDiversifiable versus non-diversifiable risk: The best way to understand diversifiable and non-diversifiable risk is to take your company and consider all of the risks that it is exposed to and then categorize these risks into whether they are likely to affect just your company, your company and a few competitors, the entire sector or the overall market.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can, try to make your assessment of whether the marginal investors in your companies are likely to be diversified. Look at both the percent of stock held in your company and the top 17 investors to make this judgment. If your assessment leads you to conclude that the marginal investor is an institution or a diversified investor, you are home free in the sense that you can now feel comfortable using traditional risk and return models in finance. If, on the other hand, you decide that the marginal investor is not diversified, we will come back in a few sessions and talk about some adjustments you may want to make to your beta calculations.\nAttachments: Post-class test and solution\n"}, {"date": "05/21/24", "body": "In yesterday\u2019s class, we went through the intuitive derivation of the CAPM. I thought that this week\u2019s puzzle should be built around the central themes of portfolio theory, which is that diversification is the best weapon against risk, since it eliminates firm specific risk. That view, though, gets push back from some big name investors, including some value investing legends and Mark Cuban (who is also a legend, at least in his own mind). You can start the puzzle by reading the arguments for and against diversification:\n\n\nFor Diversification:\u00a0https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1990/markowitz/lecture/(Harry Markowitz\u2019s Nobel Prize talk)\nFor Concentration:\u00a0http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/07/20/why-warren-buffett-doesnt-diversify-too-much.aspx\u00a0(He should not be named is named\u2026 )\n\n\nThe evidence, from looking at investor behavior, is that most individual investors side with the latter than the former (though that does not mean that it is right):\n\n\nEvidence on investors:\u00a0http://www.umass.edu/preferen/You%20Must%20Read%20This/Barber-Odean%202011.pdf\n\n\nI am going to surprise you with my view.

Obviously, I would like you to get through the entire list every week, but that is impractical.\u00a0"}, {"date": "05/22/24", "body": "We started today\u2019s class by tying up the last loose ends with risk and return models, talking about how assuming that there are no transactions costs and private information can lead us all to hold the market portfolio, and how risk can be then measured as risk added to that portfolio. We did damn the CAPM with faint praise, arguing that it does not do very well at explaining differences in returns across companies, but that it does at least as well as the alternatives. We then started on the mechanics of the model, taking about risk free rates: how to estimate the risk free rate in a currency where there is no default free entity issuing bonds in that currency and why risk free rates vary across currencies. The key lesson is that much as we would like to believe that riskfree rates are set by banks, they come from fundamentals - growth and inflation. I have a post on risk free rates that you might find of use:\nhttp://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2015/04/dealing-with-low-interest-rates.html\u00a0\nIn fact, risk free rates turned negative in a few currencies, upending what we know about risk free rates in. Here is my post on negative risk free rates.\nhttp://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2016/03/negative-interest-rates-unreal.html\u00a0\nIn the final few minutes of the session, we turned to equity risk premiums and how they are related to risk aversion.\u00a0More on that in the next class.\u00a0By the way, we have no class next Monday and\u00a0next week\u2019s class will be an entirely zoom class.

Since that priority list may still leave you uncertain, I repackaged it in terms of what your time status is from this class:\n\n\nBusy, Multiple constraints on time including health, family etc.\nTime available: <3 hours a week\n1. Do post-class tests (10-15 minutes for each class)\n2. Review lecture notes for the session (20-30 minutes for each class)\n3. Bare minimum on project company, perhaps just collecting data and raw material to assess later (30 minutes/week)\n4. In quiz week, work through at least three or four past quizzes (2018-2022) (3 hours every three or four weeks)\n\n\nBusy, Significant constraints on time\u00a0\nTime available: 3-6 hours a week\n\n1.

Review practice problems for each section and try four or five in each section (1 hour/week)\n7. In quiz week, work through all past quizzes (1997-2022) (8 hours every three or four weeks)\n8. Read stories in financial press, and craft your corporate finance response to each story (continuous)\n\n\n\nWith each of these, note that I have not set aside the time that it takes to read these long emails, and I am sorry for that. But I cannot think of a better tether to keep you connected to the class.

In making this assessment, having access to a Bloomberg terminal can speed the process, and if you get a chance, look at the YouTube video that I sent to you about using Bloomberg. If you don\u2019t have access to a terminal, never fear, since much of the data is public. You can get both the breakdown of investors into insider and institutional, as well as the top holders of your stock. Here for instance is the page for PlugPower, a US company listed on the NASDAQ (under Holders):\u00a0https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PLUG/holders?p=PLUG\n\nThe assessment of who the marginal investor in PlugPower is easy to make. It is a large institutional investor, and very diversified. \u00a0You can see that 55% of PlugPower\u2019s shares (and 61% of the float, i.e., shares that are being traded at not locked away) are held by institutions, and if you are wondering whether that is high or low, I have data on insider and institutional holdings, by sector, for US, Global, European, Emerging (with China and India as separate date sets), Japan and Australia/NZ/Canada. You can find them here:\nhttp://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/data.html\nScroll down to insider/institutional holdings and download the excel spreadsheets. If you have fallen behind in this class, there is nothing to fear. You have a whole week to catch up, and if it looks overwhelming, you should start with the entry page for the class:\nhttps://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/corpfin.html\u00a0\nEverything that we have done so far (from the class sessions, to weekly puzzles to even past emails) should be here.\u00a0"}, {"date": "05/24/24", "body": "Ahead of a long weekend, I decided that it would be a good time to send not one, but two, valuation webcasts this week. The first lt is on assessing who the top stockholders in your company are and thinking through the potential conflicts of interest you will face as a result. The webcast went a little longer than I wanted it to (it is about 24 minutes) but if you do have the list of the top stockholders in your company (the HDS page from Bloomberg, Capital IQ, Morningstar or some other source), I think you will find it useful.\u00a0\nWebcast link:\u00a0http://youtu.be/x_H_4KTeOkc\nPresentation link:\u00a0http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/cfovhds/webcasts/holders.ppt\nI hope that you get a chance to not only watch these webcasts but also try them out on your company.\u00a0\n\n\nThe second one is on the first of the three inputs into your cost of equity, the risk free rate.

In particular, I want to focus on, and provide some help on data from three sources: the company itself (annual reports, financial filings), Capital IQ (a database of all publicly traded companies, with immense amounts of accounting and market data on each) and the physical Bloomberg terminals that are in the business school:\n1. The Company: About 75% of the information, perhaps more, still come from annual reports and financial filings made by the company and the best source for this information is in the original documents (rather than on online sources, no matter how sophisticated).\u00a0I usually start by finding the company\u2019s webpage, going to the investor section and finding the most recent annual and quarterly report, as well as the analogous financial filings (10K and 10Q for US companies). Download them in pdf format, because you can then use the search box to search for the data you need in the pdf. (Warning: Do not read the annual report, until you are ready in terms of what data you want from the report)\n2. Capital IQ: I have sent you many reminders that you have access to S&P Capital IQ. It is one of the premier global corporate datasets, and given how expensive it is to access, we are lucky to have access at Stern.\u00a0\n      \u00a0\nCapital IQ Access\n\n\n\nIf you have not already done so, access Cap IQ, find your company, and it is pretty self-explanatory.\u00a0I just download into excel the income statement, the balance sheets, the cash flow statement and the segment data, and I replace the default time period (which is the last few years with the maximum period, which can 30 years or more for some companies). You now have all of the historical data that you will need for your company. While you are in Capital IQ, you can also check out the industry grouping that your company is in, screen for other companies like it (by industry group, geography, market cap etc.) and download the data you might need on those companies (I would start with betas, market capitalizations, total debt and cash, but you may need to come back to this list again later in the class). I put together a YouTube video on how to do this, if you are interested:\nhttps://youtu.be/A4hpXxval_U\u00a0\n\n3. Bloomberg terminal: Find the Bloomberg terminals in the building; for MBAs, there are four on the fourth floor of KMEC, and for undergraduates, there are four \u00a0in Tisch 316 (accessed through 305). Since these are scarce, and hogging the machines is not a good idea, I thought I would create a guide specifying not only what you need to print off for your company, as well as where to find data on those print outs. I used BP as my company, and the print out should reflect what the pages should look like now for your company:\nBloomberg Data Guide\n\n\n\nYou will note that there are only six Bloomberg groupings you should print out, ten pages, in all.\u00a0\nHDS: Just the first page\nBETA: One page\nDES: Five pages\nDDIS: One page\nCRPR: One page\nFA: One page\nIf you play this right, it should take you 10-15 minutes for your company, and you should do it as soon as you can. I know that this is my second email to you today, but to compensate, I will skip emailing you tomorrow and day after. See.. I am a compassionate person.\u00a0"}, {"date": "05/28/24", "body": "First things first. Tomorrow\u2019s class will be a zoom class, and the zoom link is below.\u00a0Please join this link at the regular class time:\nhttps://nyu.zoom.us/j/98887438518\u00a0\nSee you there.\n\n\nAs we are navigate our way through a volatile economy and market, it is a good time to think about our views on risk and how it plays out in how we react to the crisis. Both economics and finance are built on risk aversion, i.e., that investors need to be paid extra (over and above an expected value) to take risks. That notion of risk aversion has been challenged and modified over time, but it still is at the heart of how we measure risk and come up with expected returns. Economists agree that not only does risk aversion vary across individuals but it also varies, for the same individual, across time. In this puzzle, which has no right answer, I would like you to wrestle with the question of how risk averse you, explanations that you can offer for that risk aversion and the consequences for your business and investment decision making. You can find the full details of the puzzle here:\nhttp://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/cfpuzzles/cfspr21puzzle4.htm\n\n\nOne of the side products of the growth of robo advisors is a proliferation of tools that investors can use to assess how risk averse they are. This article in the New York Times nicely sets the table. In the article, though the links to free risk assessment services are no longer free. There are, however, plenty of risk aversion tests online.\u00a0Here\u2019re a couple that you can try at no cost (though the second one is longer):\n\nNJAES:\u00a0https://njaes.rutgers.edu/money/assessment-tools/investment-risk-tolerance-quiz.pdf\u00a0\nUniversity of Missouri:\u00a0https://pfp.missouri.edu/research/investment-risk-tolerance-assessment/\u00a0\n\nTake the tests, both to get a measure of how risk aversion gets measured and how risk averse you are as an individual. Then, try to answer the following questions:\n\n\n\n\nThe ERP in the market right now is about 4.5% (i.e. this is what you can expect to earn over and above the T.Bond rate on US stocks). Given your risk aversion, do you feel this premium is sufficient given how risky you think equity is as an investment? (I know that this is subjective but make your best choice)\nDo you think that your risk aversion is affected by what you read and watch? If no, why not? If yes, how?\nDo you think that your risk aversion is affected by recent market moves (up or down)? If yes, why and in what direction?\n\n\n\n"}, {"date": "05/29/24", "body": "Today's class was spent talking mostly about equity risk premiums. The key theme to take away is that equity risk premiums don't come from models or history but from our guts. When we (as investors) feel scared or hopeful about everything that is going on around us, the equity risk premium is the receptacle for those fears and hopes. Thus, a good measure of equity risk premium should be dynamic and forward looking. We looked at three different ways of estimating the equity risk premium. It is with this objective in mind that we computed an implied equity risk premium for the S&P 500, using the level of the index. If you want to try your hand at it, here is my February 2024 update:\n\nhttp://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/implprem/ERPFeb24.xlsx\nPlay with the spreadsheet. In fact, try it with today\u2019s index level and T.Bond rate and see what the ERP is right now. I also noted the path of historical implied equity risk premiums, and how they have become more unstable and higher since 2008, mentioning a greater fear of catastrophic risks than ever before. If you are interested in this topic, I wrote a piece about it last week:\nhttps://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2024/02/catastrophic-risk-investing-and.html\nI then extended this approach into other markets, and talked about how to (and tried to) estimate equity risk premiums for other markets, using the country ratings (default spreads) as a building block. You can get my 2024 start-of-the-year equity risk premiums at this link:\nhttps://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/datasets/ctryprem.xlsx\nAs a final step, see if you can find the geographic revenue distribution for your company.\u00a0You can then use my latest ERP update to get the ERP for your company. If you can find production exposure, even better. You will then have to decide whether you want ERPs based upon production, revenues or a composite of the two.\n\n\nBeta reminder: Pease do try to find a Bloomberg terminal (find the one on the fourth floor of KMEC). Click on Equities, find your stock (pinpoint the local listing; there can be dozens of listings....) and once you are on your stock's page of choices, type in BETA. A beta page should magically appear, with a two-year regression beta for your company. Print if off. If no one is waiting for the terminal, try these variations:\n1. Time period: Change the default to make it about 5 years and the interval from weekly (W) to monthly (M). Print that page off\n2. Index: The default index that Bloomberg uses is the local index (a topic for discussion next session). You can change the index. Replace your default index (usually the index of rte country in which your company is incorporated and traded with the MSCI Global Equity Ihdex in the index box and rerun the regression.\nBring the beta page (s) with you to the next class.

So, don\u2019t freak out!\n\n\nHere are some things to consider doing to catch up:\n\n\nCorporate governance: If you have not started on your corporate governance section, please do so, focusing on the question of how much power you feel you have as a shareholder in your company. To make that assessment, \u00a0you should start with whether your company has two classes of shares to see if you have already lost the game. You should then look at share holdings in the company, to see whether an individual or family has a controlling interest (which does not have to be 51%\u2026 25% or even 15% may be enough) and to examine whether you may be able to ride the backs of activist investors in the company. Once you are done, please go to the Google shared spreadsheet and enter your subjective assessment of how much power you think shareholders have in the company, on a scale of zero (no power) to two (strong power).\nMarginal investor: Staying on the sheet of top stockholders in your company, in conjunction with what percent of your company\u2019s stock is held by institutions and individuals, make a judgment on what type of investor (institutional, insider, individual) is the marginal investor in your company. Please input that too into the Google shared spreadsheet.\nRiskfree Rate & ERP: Now, that we have the risk free rate nailed down (it depends on your currency) and a way of computing ERPs for companies, try to find the geographical breakdown of revenues for your company, so that you can compute a company ERP. I will be posting in-practice guides tomorrow on both.\nBeta page:\u00a0If you can get on Bloomberg (either a physical terminal or on the virtual terminal - see email from last week), please print off the BETA page for your company and bring it to class with you.\u00a0\n\nOn a different note, the first quiz is a week from Monday (on March 4), and if you feel the urge, you can start preparing for it, though you may find the third question on each quiz a bit of a mystery at the moment.\u00a0Here are some resources:\n1. If you do want to practice, you can find the past quiz 1s that I have given for this class, with solutions, at the links below:\n\n\nPast quizzes:\u00a0https://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/cfexams/prqz1.pdf\nPast quiz solutions:\u00a0https://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/cfexams/prqz1sol.xlsx\n            It will be open book and open notes. So, no need to memorize equations.\n\n          2. There is a review webcast that I did for the quiz. If you are interested, you can get it by going to:\n\nVideo:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH8L7cW6Yns&feature=youtu.be\nSlides: \u00a0https://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pptfiles/acf3E/reviewQuiz1.ppt\u00a0\n\n          My advice on the quizzes is that you start with the most recent quizzes and work backwards, and with time constraints in mind, here is what I would recommendL\n\n\n\nTime constraint severe: Do most recent two quizzes with solutions as crutch, Do prior two with solutions as a fall back and take two quizzes without looking at solutions and with 30 minute timer.\nTime constraint average: Do most recent three quizzes with solutions as crutch, Do prior three with solutions as a fall back and take three quizzes without looking at solutions and with 30 minute timer.\n\nTime constraint not binding: Do most recent four quizzes with solutions as crutch, Do prior four with solutions as a fall back and take \u00a0four quizzes without looking at solutions and with 30 minute timer.\nWhat time constraint? Work through every quiz since 1998 and I hope that you come out with your sanity intact.\u00a0\n\n\n    On the earlier quizzes, you will notice that I don\u2019t provide an ERP in problems, and that 5.5% shows up in the answer. That is because I expected people to look up the ERP in their lecture notes, and it was roughly 5.5% then, but I have learned my lesson the hard way and provide the ERP in the problem in recent years."}, {"date": "05/31/24", "body": "\nIt is Friday and time for the in-Practice Webcasts.

We also looked at the three key pieces of output from the regression:\n      1. The intercept: This is a measure of how good or bad an investment your stock was during the period of your regression. To compute the measure correctly, you net out Rf(1-Beta) from the Intercept:\n      Jensen's alpha = Intercept - Riskfree rate (1- Beta)\n      If this number is a positive (negative) number, your stock did better (worse) than expected, after adjusting for risk and market performance.\n      2. The slope: is the beta, albeit with standard error\n      3. The R squared: measures the proportion of the risk in your stock that is market risk, with the balance being firm specific/diversifiable risk.\n      Finally, we used the beta to come up with an expected return for stock investors/cost of equity for the company, and talked about how it can be used in investment decision making.\u00a0If you can get your hands on the beta page for your company, you should be able to make these assessments for your company. \u00a0You can also get a guide to reading the Bloomberg pages for your company by clicking below:\nhttps://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/BloombergStuff/BloombergGuide2024.pdf\u00a0\n        Please try to strike while the iron is hot and get this section done for your company.\u00a0\n\n\nOn a different note, the first quiz is a week from today.

Summarizing the class, here is what we listed as the three determinants of betas:\n      \n1. Betas are determined in large part by the nature of your business. While I am not an expert on strategy, marketing or productions, decisions that you make in those disciplines can affect your beta. Thus, your decision to go for a price leader as opposed to a cost leader (I hope I am getting my erminology right) or build up a brand name has implications for your beta. As some of you probably realized today, the discussion about whether your product or service is discretionary is tied to the elasticity of its demand (an Econ 101 concept that turns out to have value)... Products and services with elastic demand should have higher betas than products with inelastic demand. And if you do get a chance, try to make that walk down Fifth Avenue...\n2. Your cost structure matters. The more fixed costs you have as a firm, the more sensitive your operating income becomes to changes in your revenues. To see why, consider two firms with very different cost structures\n Firm A\t\t\tFirm B\nRevenues\t\t100\t\t\t\t100\n- Fixed costs\t\t90\t\t\t\t0\n- Variable costs\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00\t\t\t\t\u00a090\nOperating income \u00a010\t\t\t\u00a0\t10\nConsider what will happen if revenues rise 10%. The first firm will see its operating income increase to 20 (an increase of 100%) whereas the second firm will see its operating income go up to 11 (an increase of 10%)... that is why looking at percentage change in operating income/percentage change in revenues is a measure of operating leverage.\n3. Financial leverage: When you borrow money, you create a fixed cost (interest expenses) that makes your equity earnings more volatile. Thus, the equity beta in a safe business can be outlandishly high if has lots of debt. The levered beta equation we went through is a staple for this class and we will revisit it again and again. So, start getting comfortable with it.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI know that today's class was a grind with numbers building on top of numbers. In specific, we looked at how to estimate the beta for not only a company but its individual businesses by building up to a beta, rather than trusting a single regression. With Disney, we estimated a beta for each of the five businesses it was in, a collective beta for Disney's operating businesses and a beta for Disney as a company (including its cash). \u00a0If you got lost at some stage in the class, here are some of the ways you can get unlost:\n        \n1. Review the slides that we covered today.\n            2. Try the post-class test and solution. I think it will really help bring together some of the mechanical issues involved in estimating betas.\n3. Read this short Q&A on bottom up betas which highlights the estimation process and some of its pitfalls:\nhttp://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/TenQs/TenQsBottomupBetas.htm\nSince the class built on Monday\u2019s online session, please watch it when you get a chance. In fact, the post class test and solution I am attaching relate to that class.\n\n\nIf you remember, we looked at the beta for Disney after its acquisition of Cap Cities in the class. The first step was assessing the beta for Disney after the merger. That value is obtained by taking a weighted average of the unlevered betas of the two firms using firm values (not equity) as the weights. The resulting number was 1.026. The second step is looking at how the acquisition is funded. We looked at an all equity and a $10 billion debt issue in class and I left you with the question of what would happen if the acquisition were entirely funded with debt. (If you have not tried it yet, you should perhaps hold off on reading the rest of this email right now) \n            Debt after the merger = 615+3186 + 18500 = $22,301 million ( Disney has to borrow $18.5 billion to buy Cap Cities Equity and it assumes the debt that Cap Cities used to have before the acquisition)\n            Equity after the merger = $31,100 (Disney's equity does not change)\n            D/E Ratio = 22,301/31,100= 0.7171\n            Levered beta = 1.026 (1+ (1-.36) (0.7171)) = 1.497\n            Note that I used a marginal tax rate of 36% for both companies, which was the case in 1996.\u00a0\n\n\nThat\u2019s about it for now, but your quiz is on Monday.

I know that there is some confusion about the quiz this coming Monday, as some of the rules on the webpage for the class reflect times past, not that long ago, when people bought or printed physical copies of the lecture notes and used abacuses to do calculations. So, at the risk of creating more confusion, here are the final rules and they override all existing rules and can be amended and altered only by me:\n1. Quiz Logistics:\u00a0The quiz will be in-person in the first 30 minutes of class (10.30 - 11 am) on Monday,\u00a0in Paulson Auditorium for everyone in the class. \u00a0As you come into class, please try to leave an empty seat between you and the next person in the room, since it will create some physical separation and allow you to spread your notes out more. Also, please try to keep it at only one seat because otherwise, we will run out of seats. If you have signed up with the Moses Center for additional time or other accommodations, please go to the Moses Center to take your quiz.\u00a0There will be class after the quiz. So, if you finish early, you can take a quick break but come back for the rest of the class.\u00a0\n2. Quiz Coverage\u00a0The quiz will cover\u00a0everything through bottom up betas (page 182 of lecture note packet 1).\u00a0In sum, it will cover corporate governance, the basics of risk, risk free rates, equity risk premiums (country and company) and beta.\n3. Quiz rules: It is open book, open notes, but remember that with only 30 minutes to do the quiz, you cannot afford to be looking for equations or answers to questions in the notes during the quiz.\u00a0Since many of you have your slides on tablets or on a PC, you can use either device to look at your notes, but not to use Excel, Numbers or any other laptop tool in your work.\u00a0Please bring your calculators to the quiz with you, and if you have your calculator on your device, you can use it, but just as a calculator.\u00a0\n4. Quiz work: The quiz will be four pages long, with one question on each page, and space below to answer the question.\u00a0Show your work in that section, rather than on scrap paper,, since I will be grading the quizzes (don\u2019t harass the teaching fellows, since they bear no responsibility) and I give partial credit. Since I want to give you credit for things you know, showing your work in a neat and orderly manner.\u00a0\n5. Missing the Quiz:\u00a0If you will be missing the quiz, let me know ahead of the quiz.\u00a0While you may not receive an acknowledgement, I will check after the quiz to make sure that I have heard from you ahead of the quiz, if you missed the quiz. If you do miss the quiz, the 10% will get reallocated over the rest of the exams in the class. So, if you miss quiz 1, your second and third quiz will be worth 12% apiece, and your final will be worth 36%. You will also lose the option of having your worst quiz score replaced by the average.\u00a0\nFinally, if you are having trouble opening the past quiz links, try a different browser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"date": "06/08/24", "body": "First, it is the weekend and the newsletter is attached. Second, and perhaps more important, your quiz is on Monday. I will not repeat all the links again, but I will have office hours tomorrow from 4.30-6 and the zoom link is below:\nhttps://nyu.zoom.us/j/93288431112\u00a0\nAttachment: Issue\n    5 (March 2)"}, {"date": "06/09/24", "body": "I am sorry about the mixed messages on the dates, but the quiz is definitely tomorrow in the first 30 minutes of class. As I get emails about the quiz, I thought it would be a good idea to pull together a list of the top emailed questions that I have received so far.\u00a0\n      \n\n1. Why do we use past T.Bill rates for Jensen's alpha and the current treasury bond rate for the expected return/cost of equity calculation?\n        The Jensen's alpha is the excess return you made on a weekly/monthly basis over a past time period (2 years or 5 years, depending on the regression). Since you are looking backwards and computing short-term (monthly or weekly) returns, you need to use a past, short-term rate; hence, the use of past T.Bill rates. The cost of equity is your expected return on an annual basis for the long term future. Hence, we use today's treasury bond or long term government bond rate as the riskfree rate.\n\n2. How do you decide whether to use a historical or an implied equity risk premium?\n        In a market like the US, with a long and uninterrupted history, the choice depends on whether you believe that things will revert back to the way they were (in which case you may decide to go with the historical premium) or that the world is a dynamic, ever-shifting place, in which case you should go with the implied premium. In most other markets, where you don't have a long history, it is not really a choice, since the historical premium is too noisy (big standard error) to even be in contention. Thus, I use a short cut. If it is a AAA rated country like Germany or Australia or Singapore, I use the US equity risk premium, arguing that mature markets need to share a common premium. If it is not a AAA rated country, see the answer to (4).\n\n3. How do you estimate a riskfree rate for a currency in an emerging market?\n        If you are doing your analysis in US dollars or Euros, you would use the riskfree rates in those currencies: the US treasury bond rate for US dollars and the German Euro bond for the Euro. In the local currency, you should start with the government bond rate in the local currency and take out of that number any default spread that the market may be charging (see the Mexico example in the review packet). The default spread can be obtained in one of three ways: (a) The difference between the rate on a dollar (Euro) denominated bond issued by the country and the US treasury bond rate (German Euro bond rate), (b) CDS spread for the country or (c) typical default spread given the local currency rating for the country.\n\n4. How do you adjust for the additional country risk in companies that have operations in emerging markets?\n        If the country you are analyzing is not AAA, you should adjust for the risk by adding an \"extra\" premium to your cost of equity. The simplest way to do this is to add the default spread for the country bond to the US risk premium. This will increase your equity risk premium and when multiplied by your beta will increase the cost of equity. A slightly more sophisticated approach is to adjust the default spread for the relative risk of equities versus bonds (look at the Mexico example in the review) and adding this amount to the US premium. This will give you a higher cost of equity. If you are given enough information to do the latter, do it (rather than use just the default spread). When assessing the equity risk premium for a company, look past where the company is incorporated at where it does business. The equity risk premium that you use should be a weighted average of the equity risk premiums of the countries in which the company operates.\n\n5. Why do you use revenues (rather than EBIT or EBITDA) as the basis for your weighting for ERP?\n        Note that what you would really like to know is the value of a company's different businesses/geographies, but since you don't have value, you look for proxies. While you may have a choice of different measures (revenues, EBITDA, EBIT etc), I prefer revenues for three reasons. First, it is always a positive number, which is good since I want weights that are greater than zero. Second, it is less susceptible to accounting allocation judgments than numbers lower down on the accounting statement. Third, I can convert it into a value by using an EV/Sales multiple, which I can get from the sector.\n\n6. Why do you use the average debt to equity ratio in the past to unlever a regression beta?\n        The regression beta is based upon returns over the regression time period. Hence, the debt to equity ratio that is built into the regression beta is the average debt to equity ratio over the period.\n\n7. What is the link between Debt to capital and debt to equity ratios?\n        If you have one, you can always get the other. For instance, the Fall 2006 quiz gives you the average debt to capital ratio over the last 5 years of 20%. The easiest way to convert this into a debt to equity is to set capital to 100. That would give you debt of 20 and equity of 80, based upon the debt to capital ratio of 20%. Divide 20 by 80 and you will get the debt to equity ratio of 25%.\u00a0\n\n8. How do you annualize non-annual numbers?\n        The most accurate thing to do is to compound. Thus, if 1% is your monthly rate, the annual rate is (1.01)^12-1.... if 15% is your annual rate, the monthly rate is (1.15)^(1/12) -1... When the number is low, as is usually teh case with riskfree rates, you can use the approximation of dividing by 12 (to get monthly) or 52 (to get weekly). But try to always compound the Jensen's alpha numbers, since they can be much bigger.\n\n9. What is the cash effect on beta? Why does it sometimes get taken out and sometimes get put back in?\n        I know that dealing with cash is on of the more confusing aspects of beta and cost of equity. Let's start with some basics. If a company has cash on its balance sheet, that cash is an asset with a zero beta (or at least a very low one) and it will affect the beta for the company and the beta that you observe for its equity (say, from a regression). What you do with cash will therefore depend upon what beta you are starting with and what beta you want to end up with.\n        For the pure play or unlevered beta by business: You start with the average (or median) regression beta across the comparable companies in the business. To get to a pure play beta for the business, here are the steps:\n        Step 1: Unlever the regression beta, using the gross debt to equity ratio for the sector\n        Unlevered beta for median company in sector = Regression beta/ (1+ (1- tax rate) (Debt/Equity Ratio for the sector))\n        Step 2: Clean up for the cash held by the typical company in the sector, using the median cash/ firm value for the sector (see below for firm value)\n        Unlevered beta for the business = Unlevered beta for median company/ (1 - Cash/Firm value for the sector)\n        Note that you use sector averages all the way through this process, for regression betas, debt to equity ratios and cash/firm value\n\n        Alternatively, you can use the net debt to equity ratio and cut it down to one step\n        Net Debt to Equity = (Debt - Cash)/ Market value of equity\n        Unlevered beta for the business = Levered Beta for median company /(1+ (1-tax rate) (Net Debt to Equity))\n\n        To get to the bottom up equity beta for a company: You start with the unlevered betas with the businesses and work up to the equity beta in the following steps:\n        Step 1: Compute a weighted average of the operating business betas, using the values of the operating businesses in the company:\n        Unlevered beta for operating assets of the company = Pure play betas weighted by values of the operating businesses\n        Step 2: Compute a weighted average of all of the assets of the company, with the company's cash included (since cash has a beta of zero)\n        Unlevered beta for entire company = Unlevered beta for operating assets (Value of operating assets/(Cash + Value of operating assets))\n        Step 3: Compute a levered beta for just the operating assets of the company, using the debt to equity ratio of the company\n        Levered beta for operating assets of the company = Unlevered beta for operating assets (1+ (1- tax rate) Company's D/E ratio)\n        Step 4: Compute a levered beta for all of the assets of the company, with cash included\n        Levered beta for all assets of the company = Unlevered beta for entire company (1+ (1- tax rate) Company's D/E ratio)\n        It is the beta in step 4 that is directly comparable to your regression beta. Note that all the numbers in this part are the company's numbers - for values for the businesses, cash holdings and debt/equity.\n\n10. Why do you weight unlevered betas by enterprise value (as you did in the Disney/Cap Cities acquisition) and in computing Disney's bottom up beta?\n        The unlevered beta is a beta fo the asset side of the balance sheet, right? So, when weighting these unlevered betas, you want to weight them by how much the businesses are worth (and not how much the equity is worth). That is why I used enterprise value weights in the Disney bottom up beta computation. I cheated on the Cap Cities acquisition by ignoring cash for both Disney and Cap Cities, but if cash had been provided, I would have used enterprise value. In case you are a little confused about the different values, here they are:\n\n\n\nMarket cap or Value of equity: This is the value of just equity\nFirm value = Market value of Debt + Market value of Equity\u00a0\nEnterprise value = Market value of Debt + Market value of Equity \u00a0- Cash (This of this as the value of just the operating assets of the company)\nThus, if a company has 100 million in equity, 50 million in debt and 20 million in cash:\nMarket cap = 100\nFirm value = 150\nEnterprise value = 150-20 = 130\n\n\n\n\nSorry about the long email\u2026\n"}, {"date": "06/10/24", "body": "\nI know that it is tough to sit in on a class, after you have taken a quiz and I appreciate it that so many of you did come to class.

I also gave credit for the last choice, which is that shareholders did not get to vote on the contract, since if you applied that standard, almost 90% of companies would have to retract their CEO compensation contracts, since shareholders don\u2019t directly vote on those contracts at most firms,That remains the board\u2019s job.\nThen what?\u00a0I am \u00a0attaching letter grades to the scores, but it way too early to attach any significance, especially since your worst quiz will be dropped (assuming you take all three quizzes).

Finally, w explained our preferences for market value weights on debt and equity in a cost of capital calculation, arguing that market value weights trump book value weights every single time. For the market value of debt, we argued for including both interest bearing debt converted to market value and the present value of lease commitments. \u00a0To get a cost of debt, you need a bond rating (actual or synthetic) as well as default spreads that go with these ratings. The former should be available for your company, if it is rated. If not, use the following spreadsheet to rate your company:\nhttp://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/ratings.xls\nIt comes with a lease converter, if you want to use it. The default spreads used to be accessible online for free at\u00a0bondsonline.com, but it seems to be defunct. You can get default spreads for key ratings classes (AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B and CCC & below) from the Federal Reserve website in St. Louis.\u00a0\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/searchresults/?st=option%20adjusted%20spread\nWhile you may have to extrapolate from these numbers for intermediate ratings, it is eminently doable.\u00a0Alternatively, you can get updated spreads for every ratings class from a Bloomberg terminal by typing in FIW, and resetting a couple of inputs. Assuming you can get access to a Bloomberg terminal, I put together a quick guide on how to get updated default spreads (for companies and countries):\nhttps://youtu.be/1W_E8NrwCYE\u00a0\nFiinally, I discovered the NAIC also produces a monthly update on default spreads that is easy to work with and the link to the site is below:\nhttps://content.naic.org/pbr_data.htm\n\nClick on the current year\u2019s tables, and then on Table F&G Current Spreads.\nAttachments: Post-class test and solution\n"}, {"date": "06/13/24", "body": "File this away under \u201cThere is no rest for the wicked\u201d, as I bring you back to the your project. Assuming that you have been working along with me, by now, you should have a risk free rate in the currency of your choice, an unlettered beta reflecting the business or businesses that your company is in and the equity risk premium that you have for your company. To get the unlevered beta to a levered beta, you need market values for equity and debt. With a publicly traded company, the former should be easy (market capitalization of all classes of shares) but the debt can be tricky. You should at least be able to get a book value of debt from the balance sheet (remember to count both short term and long term interest bearing debt), and if your company has leases and is following either GAAP or IFRS, the lease debt should also be there. If you don\u2019t trust accountants, and want to do this right, you can covert book debt to market debt and capitalize leases for your company, but you will need a cost of debt for your company to be able to do this, and you can get that using either an actual rating or a synthetic rating for your company.

We spent the bulk of the class describing the Rio Disney investment, and then computing the return on capital on that investment, based upon expected revenues and operating income. We also looked at what the hurdle rate for the investment should be, drawing on the notion that the discount rate for a project should reflect the risk of that project (business, geography etc.). We also extended the return on capital concept to entire companies to judge the quality of existing investments. \u00a0In the last part of the class, we talked about the process of getting from earnings to cash flows, by adding back depreciation and amortization, subtracting capital expenditures and change in working capital.

It is more contained and easier to work with. Then, try the longer life analysis. It is trickier\u2026\nIf you find yourself lacking information, make reasonable assumptions.

If it is to get to earnings, and if your final decision is not going to be based on earnings, don\u2019t waste too much time on it. (In particular, if you are spending way too much time thinking about accounting allocation or depreciation methods, you have lost the script)\nI think the case is self contained. For your protection, I think that you should stay with what is in the case. You are of course not restricted from wandering and reading whatever you want on the robot business and Tesla\u2019s future, but you run the risk of opening up new fronts in a war (with other Type A personalities in other groups who may be tempted to one up by bringing in even more outside facts to the case) that you do not want to fight. And please do not override any information that I have given you in the case. (I have given you a treasury bond rate and equity risk premiums, for instance. So, no need to make up your own\u00a0)\nThere are tax rules that you violate at your own risk. For instance, investing in physical facilities is always a capital expenditure. At the same time, make your life easy when it comes to issues like depreciation. If nothing is specified about deprecation, use the simplest method (straight line) over a reasonable life.\nThere is no one right answer to the case. In all my years of making up these cases, I have never had two groups get the same NPV for a case. There will be variations that reflect the assumptions you make at the margin. At the same time,\u00a0there are some wrong turns you can make (and i hope you do not) along the way.\nMuch of the material for the estimation of cash flows was covered yesterday and in the last two sessions. The material for the discount rate estimation is already behind us and you should be able to apply what we did with Disney to this case to arrive at the relevant numbers.\nDo not ask what-if questions until you have your base case nailed down. In fact, shoot down anyone in the group who brings up questions like \"What will happen if the margins are different or the market share changes?\" while you are doing your initial run\u2026\nDo not lose sight of the end game, which is that you have to decide based on all your number crunching whether Costco should invest in the clinic business or not.\u00a0Do not hedge, prevaricate, pass the buck or hide behind buzz words.\nThe case report itself should be short and to the point (if you are running past 4 or 5 pages, you either have discovered something truly profound or are talking in circles).

In-practice webcast:\u00a0\u00a0It covers\u00a0the question of whether your company's existing investments pass muster. Are they good investments? Do they generate or destroy value? To answer that question, we looked at estimating accounting returns - return on invested capital for the overall quality of an investment and the return on equity, for just the equity component. By comparing the first to the cost o capital and the second to the cost of equity, we argued that you can get a snapshot (at least for the year in question) of whether existing investments are value adding. The peril with accounting returns is that you are dependent upon accounting numbers: accounting earnings and accounting book value. In the webcast, I look at estimating accounting returns for Walmart in March 2013. Along the way, I talk about what to do about goodwill, cash and minority interests when computing return on capital and how leases can alter your perspective on a company. Here are the links:\n\nWebcast:\u00a0https://youtu.be/An2SduBDYQE\u00a0\n          Walmart:\u00a0https://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/cfovhds/webcasts/ROIC/walmart10K.pdf\u00a0(10K for 2012) and\u00a0http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/cfovhds/webcasts/ROIC/walmart10Klast%20year.pdf(10K for 2011)\nSpreadsheet for ROIC:\u00a0https://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/cfovhds/webcasts/ROIC/walmartreturncalculator.xls\n          Note that at the time that I did this, leases were treated as operating expenses, and I had to to do the conversion. Today\u2019s accounting does treat leases as debt, and that should make your life easier, since you can just include the lease debt from the balance sheet in total debt, and skip the conversion process. The updated version of this calculator is attached to this email. I hope you get a chance to watch the webcast. It is about 20 minutes long.\n\n2.

We have been talking, in class, about investment decisions and how best to make them. While we laid out the framework of forecasting cash flows and computing NPV, the reality is that you make the best decisions that you can, with the information that you have at the time, and the real world then delivers its own surprises. In this week\u2019s challenge, I confront this issue head on by looking at Chevron\u2019s $54 billion investment in a natural gas plant in Australia. The decision was made in 2009, when oil and gas prices were much higher and rising, and the plant is just going to start production. Take a look at the challenge:\nhttp://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/New_Home_Page/cfpuzzles/cfspr23puzzle7.htm\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOnce you have read the puzzle, try to answer the following questions:\n\n\nShould the analysts who looked at the plant in 2009 foreseen the oil price rout when making the investment decision?\u00a0\nAsssume that at today's oil prices, the present value of expected cash flows on the plant is well below the $54 billion that it cost to build the plant? Should Chevron shut the plant down today? If yes, why? If not, why not?\nAssume that you are offered $25 billion by Exxon Mobil for the plant? Would you accept it? What would determine your decision?\nNow that you have seen the cost of this deal, what would you do differently, if anything, on any new investments that you make as an oil company?\n\n\nThese are fundamental questions that get asked almost every time a big investment goes bad. Some times, investments go back because they should never have been taken in the first place, but some times investments go bad because the macro environment changed. Last year, rising riskfree rates and risk premiums pushed up the cost of capital for the median company from 6% to close to 10%. Investments that had a positive NPV when taken at the start of the year had negative NPVs by the end of the year. Wresting with investment regret is part of doing business\u2026\u00a0"}, {"date": "07/03/24", "body": "Thank you for getting your project reports and findings in on the Costco case.

When a project creates cash flows in different businesses with different risks, the discount rates used have to reflect those differential risks.\u00a0I kept the cash flows separate for the Clinic and retail and used different costs of capital for each one.\n2. When a project uses up a resource, you have to factor that cost in, but you have to do so by looking at what will happen if you do not take the project as well. In the context of capacity, the clinic project will lead to capacity being used up earlier (in year 4) rather than later (in year 11). It is the difference in the present values of these costs that should be considered, not just the cost of investing in year 4.\n3. When you decide to alter a project from finite life to a longer life, you have to behave differently in how you manage the project from the very beginning. In short, lengthening a project life is a trade off, where you settle for lower cash flows over the project life, in return for a higher ending value. In Costco Clinic terms, this will show up as more capital maintenance expenditures with the longer life than with the finite life.\n\n\nAfter the case, we looked at side costs and side benefits from projects, and how it is critical that we go beyond the hand waving (it is strategic, or good things will happened) to trying to make our best estimates of these costs and benefits and bringing them into the analysis.

You can always bring your case in and I will reassess it. \u00a0I have also allowed leeway on the revenue forecasts (unless they are egregiously off), and I have not taken points off for minor math errors. Finally, on how to read the scores, the case is out of 10 and the scoring is done accordingly.\u00a0"}, {"date": "07/05/24", "body": "\n\nFirst, my thanks for the time and sweat that went into the case reports. I appreciate it and if you are disappointed with your grade, I am truly sorry. \u00a0think all the cases are done and you should have got them already. \u00a0It is entirely possible that a couple slipped through my fingers, if you used the wrong subject head. If so, please email me with your case attachment again (with no changes of course), and make sure you put \u201cCostco Clinic\u201d in the subject.. I will go back and find your original submission in mailbox and get it graded. I am attaching that grading codes that I had sent you before, so that you can make some sense of your grade. If you feel that i have missed something in your analysis, please make your argument. I am always willing to listen. Here are some thoughts:\n\n\n\n1. Beta and cost of equity: The only absolutes I had on this part of the case was that you could not under any conditions justify using Costco's beta to analyze a project in a different business and that you cannot use book values to come up with weight. However, I was pretty flexible on different approaches to estimating betas from the list of health care companies. \u00a0 Also, if you used that cost of capital to discount the synergy benefits to the retail business. I did not make an issue of it in this case, since the differences were small, but something to think about. On the issues of estimating beta from a peer group, a couple of suggestions:\n\n\n\n\n\na. Do not take weighted averages of betas. By doing so, you lose the power of the law of large numbers working in your favor, and end up using the regression beta of the largest company or companies in the group for your company.\n\n\nb. Do not unlever each company\u2019s beta and then average: I know it feels more precise to do so, but doing operations on a flawed number (regression beta) only makes the flaws worse. So, better to average first and then unleever.\nc. Be careful pruning outliers: Much as you are tempted to remove firms that look like outliers, be careful because this is a pathway to bias. My recommendation is that you leave the outliers in your sample and use the median, instead of the average.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Cost of debt and debt ratio: The cost of debt was given, though a few of you did forget to after-tax the cost of debt. Also, a few of you include total liabilities as debt which is incompatible with a cost of capital measure. It should be just interest-bearing debt and lease debt. Finally, in computing\u00a0the present value of lease commitments, some of you counted the lease payment from last year, but that payment has already been made and is no longer a commitment.\u00a0\n\n3. Cash flows in the finite life case: I won't rehash the arguments about why we need to look at the difference between investing in year 4 and year 11 for computing the cost of the expansion . Some of you either ignored the savings in year 11 or attempted to allocate a portion of the investment in year 4, \u00a0a practice that is fine for accounting returns but not for cash flows. But here were some other items that did throw off your operating cash flows:\n\n\na. Interest expenses: The cash flows that you discount with the cost of capital should always be pre-debt cash flows. That is why it does not make sense to subtract out interest expenses before you compute taxes and income. If you do that, you will double count the tax benefits of interest expenses, once in your cash flows (by saving taxes) and once in your discount rate, through the use of an after-tax cost of debt.\nb. Working capital: The working capital was fairly clearly delineated but there were three issues that did show up. One is that a few groups used the total working capital every year, instead of the change, which is devastating to your cash flows. The other is that the working capital itself was sometimes defined incorrectly, with accounts payable being added to accounts receivable and inventory. Third, the fact that working capital investments have to be made at the start of each year means that the change in working capital will lead revenues by a year; many of you had the change in the same year or even lagging revenues. (I did not penalize you for that because it has small effect.)\u00a0\nc. G&A: If you subtract out the allocated G&A to get to operating income, the difference between the allocated and the incremental G&A has to be added back to earnings. While many groups did do this, a few added back the entire amount, instead of the amount (1- tax rate). The reason you have to do this, is because if the expense is non-incremental, the tax benefit you get from it is also non-incremental. Adding back the after-tax amount eliminates both.\nd. Capital maintenance: While I am glad that some of you were thinking about capital maintenance, putting in a large capital maintenance in the finite life case is unfair to that scenario. Why would you keep investing larger and larger amounts of money into a business as you approach the liquidation date? However, I allowed for some flexibility on this issue.\u00a0\ne. Salvage value: The salvage value should include both the working capital salvaged as well as the remaining book value in fixed non-depreciable assets.\n\n\n4. Cash flows in the longer life case: The key in this scenario is that you need more capital maintenance, starting right now. (Here is a simple test: If your after tax cash flows from years 1-15 are identical for the 15-year life and longer life scenarios, you have a problem...) \u00a0Though some groups did realize this, they often started the capital maintenance in year 16, by which point in time you are maintaining depleted assets. Those groups that did not include capital maintenance at all argued that they felt uncomfortable making estimates without information. But ignoring something is the equivalent of estimating a value of zero, which is an estimate in itself. A few of you used the defense that I had asked you not to go out of the case, but you don\u2019t have to, since your depreciation is the key indicator of how much maintenance cap ex you need. Also, you cannot keep depreciation in your cash flows (in perpetuity) and not have capital maintenance that matches the depreciation, since you will run out of assets to depreciate, sooner rather than later. The basis for capital maintenance estimates should always be depreciation and your book capital; tying capital maintenance to revenues or earnings can be dangerous. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nFinally, and this is a pet peeve of mine. So, just humor me. Please do not use the word \"net income\" when you really mean after-tax operating income. Not only is it not right, but it will create problems for you in valuation and corporate finance. Also, try to restrain your inner accountant when it comes to capital budgeting and don\u2019t do full-fledged statements of cash flows. It hurts more than it helps. As a general rule, projects don't have balance sheets, retained earnings or cash balances. Also, if a project loses money, don't create deferred tax assets or loss carryforwards but use the losses to offset against earnings right now and move on. \u00a0The grading for the case was out of 10, and there were 36 groups. For those of you who need to know where you stand relative to the rest of the class, here is what the distribution of final grades looked like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase Score\nNumber of Groups\n\n\n10\n1\n\n\n9.5\n2\n\n\n9\n4\n\n\n8.5\n9\n\n\n8\n11\n\n\n7.5\n6\n\n\n<7\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have issues with my grading, please bring them up with me.

If you have the only Irish company in your group, you have the lowest marginal tax rate in your group and other things remaining equal, should have the least debt.\nAdded discipline: Go back and check the HDS page (with the top 17 stockholders in your company). If you don't see anyone from your management team in that list and no activist investors (Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman), your company could benefit from having more debt (to discipline management).\nBankruptcy cost: To assess your company's expected bankruptcy cost, look at two variables. The first is whether they are in a stable or risky business. If you are in a risky business, you have a much higher risk of bankruptcy than if you are in a nice safe business. The second is indirect bankruptcy cost. As I noted in class, these are the negative consequences of being viewed as being in financial trouble: customers stop buying, suppliers demand cash and customers leave. If those costs can be high at your company, you should borrow less money.\nAgency costs: The more trouble lenders have in monitoring and keeping track of the money that they lend, the more borrowers will have to pay to borrow. Thus, if your company has intangible assets and difficult-to-monitor investments (R&D, for example), it should borrow less money.\nFinancial flexibility: If the investment needs in your company tend to be stable and predictable (a regulated utility, for instance), you should not value flexibility very much. If you grow through acquisitions and/or are in an unstable business, you will value it more and borrow less.\n\nI will be posting an in-practice webcast, where I take you through this process for a company, so that you have a sense of what I am looking for.

In particular, the question of what happens to the worst of your three quizzes, if you take all three, may be vexing some of you. I don\u2019t know whether this will help but I have create a scoresheet where you can enter your actual scores for the first two quizzes and the case and prospective scores for the remaining quiz and final exam, and see the total score you will have in the class. At the moment, I cannot give you a look up table that will convert that total score into a letter grade, because that will depend on how the entire class performs on the remaining quiz, final and project. That said, the cut off for an A has varied from 89 to 91, and for a A- from 88 to 90, and for a B+ from 86 to 88, over the last ten years. \u00a0Remember that the scores on this spreadsheet are not your scores, and as you enter your own scores, you will notice that the bulk of the class grade is still ahead of you, and that is good news for some of you and cautionary news for others.

For those who have done really well on the first two quizzes, it is cautionary news, since letting your guard down too soon can still cost you.

So, if you have done badly on the quizzes and can ace the final exam, your hopes of an A are intact.\n\n\n2. The Grade floor: If you are struggling on the class, but have kept trying (taking the quizzes, even though they are tough for you), there is a floor on your grade. If you take all three quizzes, and the final exam (getting at least 10/30 on the final exam) and turn in your final project (numbers and project), your grade cannot be lower than a C.

While you can download the APV spreadsheet that I have online,  I don\u2019t really see a need to do the APV analysis of your company\u2019s capital structure, since the expected bankruptcy cost is a black box. We then looked at peer group analysis, where companies decide how much to borrow by looking at what other companies in the sector do. \u00a0You can check out the debt ratios for other companies in your sector by going to my website:\nUS industry averages:\u00a0http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/datasets/dbtfund.xls\nGlobal industry averages:\u00a0http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/datasets/dbtfu\nAttachments: Post-class test and solution"}, {"date": "07/23/24", "body": "In this week\u2019s puzzle I decided to use AMC to illustrate not only the dangers of debt, but the difficulty with extracting yourself from a position of having too much debt. For those of you who do not know what AMC does, it the largest theater chain owner in the US and it has been buffeted by two major forces - the first is the slow motion disruption that streaming has brought to the entertainment business and the second is the devastation created by the COVED economic shut down. You can start with my post on the entertainment business;\nhttps://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2023/09/a-business-upended-streaming-disrupts.html\nI mention movie theatre businesses in that post, but to look at AMC\u2019s journey over the last few years, you can start by looking at their financials:\nhttps://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/AMCHistory.xls\u00a0\nYou can take a look at the stock price, where the movements have been insane (and I use that word intentionally) as AMC became a meme stock and its CEO actively encouraged players to game the stock:\n\nIn April 2024, AMC is looking disaster in the face as its market cap has dropped to $500 million and with a debt load of $19 billion plus, the debt ratio is 96.28%. While it is clearly over levered, I ran the optimal capital structure spreadsheet to assess what it could afford:\nhttps://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/AMCcapstru.xlsx\u00a0\n\n\nAMC knows that it has too much debt, and it has tried a couple of moves:\n\n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/amcs-debt-to-equity-late-payments-could-be-red-flags-warns-creditsafe-3c922c53#:~:text=Citing%20AMC's%20AMC%20second%2Dquarter,186.5%25%2C%20Creditsafe%20told%20MarketWatch.\nhttps://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/amc-stock-sale-raise-cash-1235777886/\n\n\n\n\nNeither one has stuck, and the end game may be playing out.\u00a0Here are my general questions for this week\u2019s puzzle:\n\n\nAMC has never generated significant operating profits? What allowed them to borrow so much in the first place? (Think of AMC's assets, and consider whether bankers felt more secure because of what they were lending against...)\nWhat are the factors that precipitated AMC's debt troubles?\nWhat are the pathways to survival for AMC?\n\n\nOn an entirely different note, I think that there is still some confusion about due dates and exam schedules. To be clear, here are the dates:\nApril 22; Quiz 3\u00a0\nMay 6: Final Project due (by the end of the day)\nMay 8, 11.15- 1.15: Early Final Exam option\nMay 13, 11 - 1: Scheduled Final Exam\nHope that helps.\u00a0"}, {"date": "07/24/24", "body": "In today's class, we looked at the design principles for debt. We started by completing a five step process for designing the perfect debt before looking at both intuitive and quantitative ways of debt design. In particular, we looked at a macro economic regression of firm value/operating income against interest rates, GDP, inflation and exchange rates.\u00a0Keeping in mind the objective of matching debt to assets, think about the typical investments that your firm makes and try to design the right debt for the project. If your firm has multiple businesses, design the right kind of debt for each business. In making these judgments, you should try to think about\n      - whether you would use short term or long term debt\n      - what currency your debt should be in\n      - whether the debt should be fixed or floating rate debt\n      - whether you should use straight or convertible debt\n      - what special features you would add to your debt to insulate the company from default\n      Your objective is to get the tax advantages without exposing yourself to default risk.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you want to carry this forward and do a quantitative analysis of your debt, you can try regressing enterprise value and operating income at your firm against macroeconomic variable. The spreadsheet below helps you do that:\u00a0\nhttp://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/macrodur.xlsx\u00a0\n\nIt has annual and quarterly data through 2023. Just a warning that it is extremely noisy and may spit out output that does not make sense.\u00a0It also contains the sector averages, broken down by SIC code. The post class test & solution for today is attached.\nAttachments: Post-class test and solution\n"}, {"date": "07/25/24", "body": "your company), you are well in place to complete your intuitive analysis. In my view, this is the more critical part of debt design (more important that the quantitative analysis that I will describe in the rest of this email). \u00a0If you plan to do a quantitative analysis of your debt. I have attached the spreadsheet that has the macroeconomic data on interest rates, inflation, GDP growth and the weighted dollar from 1986 to the present (I updated it to include 2022 data. The best place to find the macro economic data, if you want to do it yourself, is to go to the Federal Reserve site in St. Louis:\n\nhttp://www.research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/\nGive it a shot and download the FRED app on your iPad and iPhone. You can dazzle (or bore) your acquaintances with financial trivia. You can enter the data for your firm and the spreadsheet will compute the regression coefficients against each. You can use annual data (if your firm has been around 5 years or more). If it has been listed a shorter period, you may need to use quarterly data on your firm. The data you will need on your firm are:\n- Operating income each period (this is the EBIT)\n- Firm or Enterprise value each period (Market value of equity + Total or Net Debt); you can use book value of debt because it will be difficult to estimate market value of debt for each period. You can also enterprise value (which is market value of equity + net debt), if you are so inclined. I know that you should be including the present value of lease commitments each period, but that would require doing it each year for the last ten. One way to get this data is to use the FA function in Bloomberg or from S&P Capital IQ. \u00a0\n\n\nI have to warn you in advance that these regressions are exceedingly noisy and the spreadsheet also includes\u00a0bottom-up estimates by industry. There is one catch. When I constructed this spreadsheet, I was able to get the data broken down by SIC codes. SIC codes are four digit numbers, which correspond to different industries. The spreadsheet lists the industries that go with the SIC code, but it is a grind finding your business or businesses. You can check this list out though it is not exactly user friendly.\nhttps://www.sec.gov/corpfin/division-of-corporation-finance-standard-industrial-classification-sic-code-list\n\n\n\u00a0My suggestion on this spreadsheet. I think it should come in low on your priority list. In fact, focus on the intuitive analysis primarily and use this spreadsheet only if you have to the time and the inclination. My webcast for tomorrow will go through how best to use the spreadsheet.\u00a0\n\n\n        The third and final quiz is on Monday (April 22).
